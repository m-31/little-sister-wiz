"""One run of a check, the way the engine does it.

The engine calls :meth:`~little_sister.checks.Check.measure` and then
:meth:`~little_sister.checks.Check.grade` (little-sister ADR-0086), and a test that
wants *the result of running this check* wants both. Written once here rather than in
every test, and deliberately **not** a method on the check: a convenience that ran the
two halves together would be the thing every author reached for, and the seam would
quietly stop being a seam. The library's own suite keeps the same helper for the same
reason; its tests do not ship, so this one is ours.
